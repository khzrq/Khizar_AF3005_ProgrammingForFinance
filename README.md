Assignment 1:Smart Financial Management System

The integration of automation into financial management systems presents a significant opportunity to address longstanding issues of inefficiency, risk assessment, and user trust. By leveraging Python’s powerful libraries and interactive tools, this approach ensures that financial operations are transparent, streamlined, and efficient, fostering confidence among users. The implementation of intelligent algorithms further automates key financial processes, reducing the need for manual oversight and minimizing the likelihood of errors. This transformation enhances the security and efficiency of financial decision-making while encouraging broader participation by providing users with real-time insights.

The proposed Smart Financial Management System redefines how financial operations are handled, offering a transparent, data-driven, and automated solution. By addressing the limitations of traditional financial management methods and creating a seamless user experience, the system stands as a testament to technology’s potential to revolutionize financial decision-making. In contrast to conventional approaches, which often suffer from issues such as subjective risk assessments, manual inefficiencies, and lack of predictive insights, this solution guarantees that every financial decision is backed by data, automation, and transparency. This fundamentally shifts the paradigm of financial management, making it a more efficient and equitable system for all users.

Assignment 2: Portfolio Optimzation by Weightage of Investment

Portfolio Investment Weight Optimization using Streamlit

📌 Project Overview
This project is an **interactive web application** built with **Python and Streamlit**, designed to help users optimize their investment portfolio based on **historical stock data**. The application allows users to **input their desired stocks**, fetches their **historical returns** using **Yahoo Finance**, and applies **mean-variance optimization** to allocate portfolio weights efficiently. Additionally, the app generates an **analysis report** using **QuantStats** and provides **visualizations** for better insights into portfolio performance.

## 🔑 Key Features

✅ **User-Defined Stock Selection** – Users can enter their preferred stock tickers.  
✅ **Real-Time Data Fetching** – Retrieves historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance.  
✅ **Portfolio Optimization** – Uses **Mean-Variance Optimization** to allocate ideal weights.  
✅ **QuantStats Analysis Report** – Generates an interactive **HTML report** of stock performance.  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Displays **cumulative returns** and **portfolio allocations** using charts.  
✅ **Downloadable Report** – Users can download a **detailed portfolio report**.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Streamlit** – Web UI framework for interactivity  
- **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)** – Fetching historical stock data  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data processing and analysis  
- **SciPy** – Portfolio optimization using `scipy.optimize.minimize`  
- **QuantStats** – Generating stock analysis reports  
- **Matplotlib** – Plotting stock performance graphs

## 🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ **User inputs stock tickers** (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL).  
2️⃣ **The app fetches historical stock prices** and calculates daily returns.  
3️⃣ **Portfolio weights are optimized** using Mean-Variance Optimization.  
4️⃣ **Visualizations** (Pie charts, Return plots) are generated.  
5️⃣ **An interactive QuantStats report is created** and displayed in the app.  
6️⃣ **Users can download the analysis report** for further insights.

## 📄 Future Enhancements

🔹 **Real-Time Portfolio Tracking** – Integrate APIs for real-time stock monitoring.  
🔹 **Risk-Return Metrics** – Include Sharpe Ratio, Alpha, and Beta analysis.  
🔹 **Multi-Asset Support** – Extend to **cryptocurrencies, forex, and bonds**.  
🔹 **Backtesting Module** – Allow users to simulate portfolio performance over time.
